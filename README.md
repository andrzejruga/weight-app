# Weight Tracker App

This project is an app I made for my personal use. It replaces the spreadsheet I've been using for a few years, that helped me and my wife to keep track of our daily weight. The app looks a lot better then the spreadsheet, so I decided to make it public.<br>
To check the app live, go to [https://weight.ruga.pl/](https://weight.ruga.pl/).<br>
Everyone can sign up, then sign in and then explore the app, but only me and my wife are authorized to add and remove data.

I made this app using React with Redux. All the data, both weight records and users data, are stored in Firebase.<br>
Firebase is also used for user authentication.<br>
There are still many features that could be added, such as separate profiles for new users, data visualization (charts) and many more. I might be adding them in the future.

I didn't use any CSS frameworks. Instead I used SCSS with BEM, and CSS Grid for the layout (with a bit of flexbox in navigation bar).

This was my first self made project using Redux and Firebase. I must admit, I had some problems with these tools.<br>
The most helpful were [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) Redux and Firebase turorials on YouTube, so big thanks to this guy!
